# netblocks

This project is a clone of [blockfinder](https://github.com/ioerror/blockfinder/)
which is originally written in python by [ioerror](https://github.com/ioerror)

I've created this project to help myself practice and get more familiar with Golang.

I'm sourcing my 3rd party library decisions to https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go when I need them.
